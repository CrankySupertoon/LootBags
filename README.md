LootBags Patched
========

A Patched Version of Lootbags for 1.12.2

LootBags has a Custom License that says when the Mod Dev is Absence someone can modify the mod. I told Malorolam about this Patch and will take it down if he so desires. 100% of Curse Points will be Transfered to him.

```1a: If a modified version of the code is to be used to update the mod in my absence, whether percieved or actual, regardless if the work is done independantly or from the request of a pack developer, inform me of the action.```
